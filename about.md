Hey there! I'm Sean (Xiangyu) Xie, a passionate ML engineer and data scientist currently pursuing my M.Eng. in Operations Research and Information Engineering at Cornell University. But there's so much more to my story than just the academic credentials.

## üöÄ My Mission

I believe in the power of data to transform how we understand and interact with the world. Whether it's building AI systems that can understand sports like a seasoned analyst or creating data pipelines that process billions of tokens, I'm driven by the challenge of turning complex problems into elegant solutions.

> "The best way to predict the future is to invent it." - Alan Kay

This quote resonates deeply with me. Every day, I work towards building the future through intelligent systems and innovative approaches to machine learning.

## üéØ What Drives Me

### Technical Excellence
I'm obsessed with writing clean, efficient code and building systems that not only work but work beautifully. From optimizing RWKV architectures to designing scalable data pipelines, I believe that technical craftsmanship matters.

### Continuous Learning
Technology evolves rapidly, and so do I. Whether it's diving deep into transformer architectures, exploring new visualization techniques, or understanding the latest in MLOps, I'm always pushing the boundaries of my knowledge.

### Impact & Innovation
I don't just want to build things‚ÄîI want to build things that matter. OnlySportsLM isn't just a model; it's a demonstration that specialized AI can democratize expertise and make intelligent analysis accessible to everyone.
